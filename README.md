- 👋 Hi, I’m @garymarkfuller
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (especially AI/ML), forensic psychology, politics, physics, science fiction, fantasy, music and gaming (TCGs, TTRPGs and MMOs).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JS, PHP, Python and ML/AI by working in web development and studying for a degree in computing and IT with the Open University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help to prevent harm and that support the vulnerable.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm on Twitter as garygabbles, on Facebook as garymarkfuller and on most other platforms as phobosdeimosg (or just phobosdeimos). -
